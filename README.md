# dynamic-disounting-app
This app removes discounting approval friction between deal desk, sales, finance &amp; product by incorporating balanced discounting strategies for multi-product, multi-year, partner, emerging markets, competitive forces, product margin, LTV, and credit risk.

# Setting app parameters
This app was preconfigured with some assumptions based on a mock-SaaS-company but leveraging a publically available price list. These assumptions should be configured to your company specifics.  Analysis on company financial performance and trends are needed.  Here is a list of analysis/parameters to consider:
* commercial list price
* product margin (this can be segmented based on future growth potential in regions or customer segments)
* partner impact to GRR, NRR, and win rates (especially in newer markets)
* partner impact to credit risk exposure in higher risk segments
* regional negotiation and discounting trends
* strategic account discount to LTV
* win rates against competitors
* Multi-year impact to OTR or GRR
* Multi-product impact to NRR and Acct Retention

Optional parameters to include:
* partner program entitlements including incumbency
* bad debt exposure by region
* payment terms
* volume based pricing (added discounts)

NOTE: This app was developed to be in the hands of sales and deal desk giving the sellers more transparency on pricing optionality to navigate deal structure and options with their customers.  Margin is exposed and could serve as incentive lever for a VP of Sales (or front line sales managers) so that sellers are coached to sell value.
